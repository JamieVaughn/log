We all have Imaginations of various capacities and vividness. It's an image in our mind that represents a vision, goal or idea. It's usually hopeful and inspiring and leaves the imaginer happy even jubilant at a the possibilities it promises.

But if that image is left in our mind only, it's only good for one person, which is to say not that good. How can do we transfer that image to other minds to help us execute that idea and manifest it in the real world?

Language as the compression algorithm of our imagination.

Pictures as a higher fiedlity compression algorithm

But imagination isn't constrtained by a physics and doesn't even necessarily have to be internally consistent.

This is why all transfers of imagination are lossy form individual to individual.

We often try to merely explain an application idea to a developer hoping they can then implement it, but honestly that is a fool's errand and hopeless task for the developer. They will get it wrong with absolute certianty from just a verbal or written description.

With design tools like figma we can improve on that but even those don't always capture everything, like empty/error states, some anmiations, unforeseen bugs, impossible states, etc.

With digital imagery we can get much closer to representing the image of the imagination, but remember how imaginations don't have a physics or internal consistency? This is why even figma and suh tools are lossy... you will find that those 8 boxes you imagined don't actually fit between the sidebars even though they somehow did in your mind's eye.

This is why development can take so long. Sure thinking of the logic, then writing the code, then testing it and deploying it, etc all take time. But most of the time is in this lossy series of image transfers from the imaginer to the implementer.
